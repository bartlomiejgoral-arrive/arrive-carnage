## Performance Tips

# Performance Tips

### General

- Only optimize when you need to! PixiJS can handle a fair amount of content off the bat
- Be mindful of the complexity of your scene. The more objects you add the slower things will end up
- Order can help, for example sprite / graphic / sprite / graphic is slower than sprite / sprite / graphic / graphic
- Some older mobile devices run things a little slower. Passing in the option `useContextAlpha: false` and `antialias: false` to the Renderer or Application can help with performance
- Culling is disabled by default as it's often better to do this at an application level or set objects to be `cullable = true`. If you are GPU-bound it will improve performance; if you are CPU-bound it will degrade performance

### Sprites

- Use Spritesheets where possible to minimize total textures
- Sprites can be batched with up to 16 different textures (dependent on hardware)
- This is the fastest way to render content
- On older devices use smaller low resolution textures
- Add the extention `@0.5x.png` to the 50% scale-down spritesheet so PixiJS will visually-double them automatically
- Draw order can be important

### Graphics

- Graphics objects are fastest when they are not modified constantly (not including the transform, alpha or tint!)
- Graphics objects are batched when under a certain size (100 points or smaller)
- Small Graphics objects are as fast as Sprites (rectangles, triangles)
- Using 100s of graphics complex objects can be slow, in this instance use sprites (you can create a texture)

### Texture

- Textures are automatically managed by a Texture Garbage Collector
- You can also manage them yourself by using `texture.destroy()`
- If you plan to destroy more than one at once add a random delay to their destruction to remove freezing
- Delay texture destroy if you plan to delete a lot of textures yourself

### Text

- Avoid changing it on every frame as this can be expensive (each time it draws to a canvas and then uploads to GPU)
- Bitmap Text gives much better performance for dynamically changing text
- Text resolution matches the renderer resolution, decrease resolution yourself by setting the `resolution` property, which can consume less memory

### Masks

- Masks can be expensive if too many are used: e.g., 100s of masks will really slow things down
- Axis-aligned Rectangle masks are the fastest (as they use scissor rect)
- Graphics masks are second fastest (as they use the stencil buffer)
- Sprite masks are the third fastest (they use filters). They are really expensive. Do not use too many in your scene!

### Filters

- Release memory: `container.filters = null`
- If you know the size of them: `container.filterArea = new Rectangle(x,y,w,h)`. This can speed things up as it means the object does not need to be measured
- Filters are expensive, using too many will start to slow things down!

### BlendModes

- Different blend modes will cause batches to break (de-optimize)
- ScreenSprite / NormalSprite / ScreenSprite / NormalSprite would be 4 draw calls
- ScreenSprite / ScreenSprite / NormalSprite / NormalSprite would be 2 draw calls

### Events

- If an object has no interactive children use `interactiveChildren = false`. The event system will then be able to avoid crawling through the object
- Setting `hitArea = new Rectangle(x,y,w,h)` as above should stop the event system from crawling through the object

## Render Groups

# Render Groups

## Understanding RenderGroups in PixiJS

As you delve deeper into PixiJS, especially with version 8, you'll encounter a powerful feature known as RenderGroups. Think of RenderGroups as specialized containers within your scene graph that act like mini scene graphs themselves. Here's what you need to know to effectively use Render Groups in your projects:

### What Are Render Groups?

Render Groups are essentially containers that PixiJS treats as self-contained scene graphs. When you assign parts of your scene to a Render Group, you're telling PixiJS to manage these objects together as a unit. This management includes monitoring for changes and preparing a set of render instructions specifically for the group. This is a powerful tool for optimizing your rendering process.

### Why Use Render Groups?

The main advantage of using Render Groups lies in their optimization capabilities. They allow for certain calculations, like transformations (position, scale, rotation), tint, and alpha adjustments, to be offloaded to the GPU. This means that operations like moving or adjusting the Render Group can be done with minimal CPU impact, making your application more performance-efficient.

In practice, you're utilizing Render Groups even without explicit awareness. The root element you pass to the render function in PixiJS is automatically converted into a RenderGroup as this is where its render instructions will be stored. Though you also have the option to explicitly create additional RenderGroups as needed to further optimize your project.

This feature is particularly beneficial for:

- **Static Content:** For content that doesn't change often, a Render Group can significantly reduce the computational load on the CPU. In this case static refers to the scene graph structure, not that actual values of the PixiJS elements inside it (eg position, scale of things).
- **Distinct Scene Parts:** You can separate your scene into logical parts, such as the game world and the HUD (Heads-Up Display). Each part can be optimized individually, leading to overall better performance.

### Examples

```ts
const myGameWorld = new Container({
  isRenderGroup: true,
});

const myHud = new Container({
  isRenderGroup: true,
});

scene.addChild(myGameWorld, myHud);

renderer.render(scene); // this action will actually convert the scene to a render group under the hood
```

Check out the [container example](/8.x/examples/?example=container_transform_pivot_basic).

### Best Practices

- **Don't Overuse:** While Render Groups are powerful, using too many can actually degrade performance. The goal is to find a balance that optimizes rendering without overwhelming the system with too many separate groups. Make sure to profile when using them. The majority of the time you won't need to use them at all!
- **Strategic Grouping:** Consider what parts of your scene change together and which parts remain static. Grouping dynamic elements separately from static elements can lead to performance gains.

By understanding and utilizing Render Groups, you can take full advantage of PixiJS's rendering capabilities, making your applications smoother and more efficient. This feature represents a powerful tool in the optimization toolkit offered by PixiJS, enabling developers to create rich, interactive scenes that run smoothly across different devices.

## Render Layers

# Render Layers

The PixiJS Layer API provides a powerful way to control the **rendering order** of objects independently of their **logical parent-child relationships** in the scene graph. With RenderLayers, you can decouple how objects are transformed (via their logical parent) from how they are visually drawn on the screen.

Using RenderLayers ensures these elements are visually prioritized while maintaining logical parent-child relationships. Examples include:

- A character with a health bar: Ensure the health bar always appears on top of the world, even if the character moves behind an object.

- UI elements like score counters or notifications: Keep them visible regardless of the game world’s complexity.

- Highlighting Elements in Tutorials: Imagine a tutorial where you need to push back most game elements while highlighting a specific object. RenderLayers can split these visually. The highlighted object can be placed in a foreground layer to be rendered above a push back layer.

This guide explains the key concepts, provides practical examples, and highlights common gotchas to help you use the Layer API effectively.

---

### **Key Concepts**

1. **Independent Rendering Order**:
   - RenderLayers allow control of the draw order independently of the logical hierarchy, ensuring objects are rendered in the desired order.

2. **Logical Parenting Stays Intact**:
   - Objects maintain transformations (e.g., position, scale, rotation) from their logical parent, even when attached to RenderLayers.

3. **Explicit Object Management**:
   - Objects must be manually reassigned to a layer after being removed from the scene graph or layer, ensuring deliberate control over rendering.

4. **Dynamic Sorting**:
   - Within layers, objects can be dynamically reordered using `zIndex` and `sortChildren` for fine-grained control of rendering order.

---

### **Basic API Usage**

First lets create two items that we want to render, red guy and blue guy.

```typescript
const redGuy = new PIXI.Sprite('red guy');
redGuy.tint = 0xff0000;

const blueGuy = new PIXI.Sprite('blue guy');
blueGuy.tint = 0x0000ff;

stage.addChild(redGuy, blueGuy);
```

![alt text](render-layers/image-1.png)

Now we know that red guy will be rendered first, then blue guy. Now in this simple example you could get away with just sorting the `zIndex` of the red guy and blue guy to help reorder.

But this is a guide about render layers, so lets create one of those.

Use `renderLayer.attach` to assign an object to a layer. This overrides the object’s default render order defined by its logical parent.

```typescript
// a layer..
const layer = new RenderLayer();
stage.addChild(layer);
layer.attach(redGuy);
```

![alt text](render-layers/image-2.png)

So now our scene graph order is:

```
|- stage
    |-- redGuy
    |-- blueGuy
    |-- layer
```

And our render order is:

```
|- stage
    |-- blueGuy
    |-- layer
        |-- redGuy

```

This happens because the layer is now the last child in the stage. Since the red guy is attached to the layer, it will be rendered at the layer's position in the scene graph. However, it still logically remains in the same place in the scene hierarchy.

#### **3. Removing Objects from a Layer**

Now let's remove the red guy from the layer. To stop an object from being rendered in a layer, use `removeFromLayer`. Once removed from the layer, its still going to be in the scene graph, and will be rendered in its scene graph order.

```typescript
layer.detach(redGuy); //  Stop rendering the rect via the layer
```

![alt text](render-layers/image-1.png)

Removing an object from its logical parent (`removeChild`) automatically removes it from the layer.

```typescript
stage.removeChild(redGuy); // if the red guy was removed from the stage, it will also be removed from the layer
```

![alt text](render-layers/image-3.png)

However, if you remove the red guy from the stage and then add it back to the stage, it will not be added to the layer again.

```typescript
// add red guy to his original position
stage.addChildAt(redGuy, 0);
```

![alt text](render-layers/image-1.png)

You will need to reattach it to the layer yourself.

```typescript
layer.attach(redGuy); // re attach it to the layer again!
```

![alt text](render-layers/image-2.png)

This may seem like a pain, but it's actually a good thing. It means that you have full control over the render order of the object, and you can change it at any time. It also means you can't accidentally add an object to a container and have it automatically re-attach to a layer that may or may not still be around - it would be quite confusing and lead to some very hard to debug bugs!

#### **5. Layer Position in Scene Graph**

The layer’s position in the scene graph determines its render priority relative to other layers and objects.

```typescript
// reparent the layer to render first in the stage
stage.addChildAt(layer, 0);
```

## ![alt text](render-layers/image-1.png)

### **Complete Example**

Here’s a real-world example that shows how to use RenderLayers to set ap player ui on top of the world.

```ts
// description: This example demonstrates the use of RenderLayer to manage the rendering order of UI elements in a scene with multiple sprites and filters using PixiJS.
import {
  Application,
  Assets,
  Container,
  DisplacementFilter,
  RenderLayer,

  TilingSprite,
} from 'pixi.js';
import { Fish } from './Fish';

(async () => {
  // Create a new application
  const app = new Application();

  // Initialize the application
  await app.init({ width: 630, height: 410, antialias: true });

  // Append the application canvas to the document body
  document.body.appendChild(app.canvas);
  // move the canvas to the center of the screen
  app.canvas.style.position = 'absolute';
  app.canvas.style.top = `${window.innerHeight / 2 - app.canvas.height / 2}px`;
  app.canvas.style.left = `${window.innerWidth / 2 - app.canvas.width / 2}px`;

  // Load textures
  await Assets.load([
    `https://pixijs.com/assets/pond/displacement_BG.jpg`,

  ]);

  const background = Sprite.from(
    'https://pixijs.com/assets/pond/displacement_BG.jpg',
  );

  const pondContainer = new Container();

  pondContainer.addChild(background);

  app.stage.addChild(pondContainer);

  const displacementMap = Assets.get(

  );

  displacementMap.source.wrapMode = 'repeat';

  const displacementSprite = Sprite.from(displacementMap);
  const displacementFilter = new DisplacementFilter(displacementSprite, 40);

  pondContainer.addChild(displacementSprite);
  pondContainer.filters = [displacementFilter];

  const uiLayer = new RenderLayer();

  const fishes = [];

  const names = [

  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    const fish = new Fish(

      textures[i % textures.length],
    );

    fishes.push(fish);
    pondContainer.addChild(fish);

    fish.x = Math.random() * 630;
    fish.y = Math.random() * 410;

    uiLayer.attach(fish.ui);
  }

  const waterOverlay = TilingSprite.from(
    Assets.get('https://pixijs.com/assets/pond/overlay.png'),
  );

  waterOverlay.width = 630;
  waterOverlay.height = 410;

  pondContainer.addChild(waterOverlay);

  app.stage.addChild(uiLayer);

  // Animate the mask
  app.ticker.add(() => {
    waterOverlay.tilePosition.x += 0.5;
    waterOverlay.tilePosition.y += 0.5;

    displacementSprite.x += 0.5;
    displacementSprite.y += 0.5;

    fishes.forEach((fish) => fish.update());
  });
})();
```

```ts
import { Container, Sprite } from 'pixi.js';
import { CharacterUI } from './CharacterUI';

export class Fish extends Container {
  ui;
  _speed = 1 + Number(Math.random());
  _direction = Math.random() * Math.PI * 2;
  fishView;

  constructor(name, texture) {
    super();

    this.fishView = new Sprite(texture);

    this.fishView.anchor.set(0.5);

    this.addChild(this.fishView);

    this.ui = new CharacterUI(name, 20);
    this.ui.y = 0;
    this.addChild(this.ui);
  }

  update() {
    this._direction += 0.001;

    this.fishView.rotation = Math.PI - this._direction;
    this.x += this._speed * Math.cos(-this._direction);
    this.y += this._speed * Math.sin(-this._direction);

    // wrap around the screen
    const padding = 100;
    const width = 630;
    const height = 410;

    if (this.x > width + padding) this.x -= width + padding * 2;
    if (this.x < -padding) this.x += width + padding * 2;
    if (this.y > height + padding) this.y -= height + padding * 2;
    if (this.y < -padding) this.y += height + padding * 2;
  }
}
```

```ts
import { Container, Graphics, Text } from 'pixi.js';

export class CharacterUI extends Container {
  constructor(name) {
    super();

    const label = new Text({
      text: name,
      resolution: 2,
      style: { fontSize: 16, fill: 0x000000 },
      anchor: 0.5,
    });

    const padding = 10;

    const bg = new Graphics()
      .roundRect(
        -label.width / 2 - padding,
        -label.height / 2 - padding,

        label.height + padding * 2,
        20,
      )
      .fill({

        alpha: 1,
      });

    this.addChild(bg, label);
  }
}
```

### **Gotchas and Things to Watch Out For**

1. **Manual Reassignment**:
   - When an object is re-added to a logical parent, it does not automatically reassociate with its previous layer. Always reassign the object to the layer explicitly.

2. **Nested Children**:
   - If you remove a parent container, all its children are automatically removed from layers. Be cautious with complex hierarchies.

3. **Sorting Within Layers**:
   - Objects in a layer can be sorted dynamically using their `zIndex` property. This is useful for fine-grained control of render order.

   ```javascript
   rect.zIndex = 10; // Higher values render later
   layer.sortableChildren = true; // Enable sorting
   layer.sortRenderLayerChildren(); // Apply the sorting
   ```

4. **Layer Overlap**:
   - If multiple layers overlap, their order in the scene graph determines the render priority. Ensure the layering logic aligns with your desired visual output.

---

### **Best Practices**

1. **Group Strategically**: Minimize the number of layers to optimize performance.
2. **Use for Visual Clarity**: Reserve layers for objects that need explicit control over render order.
3. **Test Dynamic Changes**: Verify that adding, removing, or reassigning objects to layers behaves as expected in your specific scene setup.

By understanding and leveraging RenderLayers effectively, you can achieve precise control over your scene's visual presentation while maintaining a clean and logical hierarchy.

## Garbage Collection

# Managing Garbage Collection in PixiJS

Efficient resource management is crucial for maintaining optimal performance in any PixiJS application. This guide explores how PixiJS handles garbage collection, the tools it provides, and best practices for managing GPU resources effectively.

## Explicit Resource Management with `destroy`

PixiJS objects, such as textures, meshes, and other GPU-backed data, hold references that consume memory. To explicitly release these resources, call the `destroy` method on objects you no longer need. For example:

```javascript
import { Sprite } from 'pixi.js';

const sprite = new Sprite(texture);
// Use the sprite in your application

// When no longer needed
sprite.destroy();
```

Calling `destroy` ensures that the object’s GPU resources are freed immediately, reducing the likelihood of memory leaks and improving performance.

## Managing Textures with `texture.unload`

In cases where PixiJS’s automatic texture garbage collection is insufficient, you can manually unload textures from the GPU using `texture.unload()`:

```javascript
import { Texture } from 'pixi.js';

const texture = Texture.from('image.png');

// Use the texture

// When no longer needed
texture.unload();
```

This is particularly useful for applications that dynamically load large numbers of textures and require precise memory control.

## Automatic Texture Garbage Collection with `TextureGCSystem`

PixiJS also includes the `TextureGCSystem`, a system that manages GPU texture memory. By default:

- **Removes textures unused for 3600 frames** (approximately 1 minute at 60 FPS).
- **Checks every 600 frames** for unused textures.

### Customizing `TextureGCSystem`

You can adjust the behavior of `TextureGCSystem` to suit your application:

- **`textureGCActive`**: Enable or disable garbage collection. Default: `true`.
- **`textureGCMaxIdle`**: Maximum idle frames before texture cleanup. Default: `3600` frames.
- **`textureGCCheckCountMax`**: Frequency of garbage collection checks (in frames). Default: `600` frames.

Example configuration:

```javascript
import { Application } from 'pixi.js';

const app = new Application();

await app.init({
  textureGCActive: true, // Enable texture garbage collection
  textureGCMaxIdle: 7200, // 2 hours idle time
  textureGCCheckCountMax: 1200, // Check every 20 seconds at 60 FPS
});
```

## Best Practices for Garbage Collection in PixiJS

1. **Explicitly Destroy Objects:** Always call `destroy` on objects you no longer need to ensure GPU resources are promptly released.
2. **Use Pooling:** Reuse objects with a pooling system to reduce allocation and deallocation overhead.
3. **Proactively Manage Textures:** Use `texture.unload()` for manual memory management when necessary.

By following these practices and understanding PixiJS’s garbage collection mechanisms, you can create high-performance applications that efficiently utilize system resources.
